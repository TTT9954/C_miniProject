This project is a small game to ask the user to guess any English word with 5 characters.
The prompt is to see the color of each character as follows:
+ the red color: totally wrong (not included in the list of correct words).
+ the yellow color: the character is correct, but in the wrong position.
+ the green color: the charecter is correct and in the right position.
